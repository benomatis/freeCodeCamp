I forked [the original freeCodeCamp codebase](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) to clarify one tiny thing that I found slightly misleading: see Pull Request [Add explicit text to instruction to keep the word 'Like' in the button next to the icon](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/15448)

To learn more about the freeCodeCamp codebase and how you can contribute read [the original README.md](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/README.md).
